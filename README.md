# MiSTer_GroovyRelay

A Plex-to-MiSTer cast-target bridge. Run it alongside your Plex Media
Server; it advertises itself as a Plex cast target on the LAN, and when
you pick it from the Plex client's "Cast" menu it transcodes the
selected title through FFmpeg and streams raw RGB fields + PCM audio
over the [GroovyMiSTer](docs/references/groovy_mister.md) UDP protocol
into a MiSTer FPGA. The MiSTer drives a 15 kHz analog CRT directly,
giving you genuine 480i NTSC video for Plex content — no HDMI-to-CRT
scaler, no tearing, correct interlace motion.

## Hardware requirements

- MiSTer FPGA with Analogue I/O board (or equivalent) wired to a
  15 kHz-capable CRT (consumer, PVM, arcade, etc.)
- A host on the same LAN running Docker (Linux, Unraid, Synology, a
  Raspberry Pi 4/5 — anything with a few spare CPU cycles and
  gigabit-class networking)
- A Plex Media Server reachable from that host
- A GroovyMiSTer-capable MiSTer core running (e.g., `Groovy`, `MARS`,
  or any other receiver that speaks the same protocol)

The bridge itself is stateless and light — a few hundred MB of RAM and
one FFmpeg worker per active cast.

## Quick start (Docker)

```bash
# 1. Create a config directory and drop in an edited copy of the example.
mkdir -p /opt/mister-groovy-relay
docker run --rm --network=host \
  -v /opt/mister-groovy-relay:/config \
  jedivoodoo/mister-groovy-relay:latest \
  --config /config/config.example.toml --help || true

# 2. Copy the example out, edit to point at your MiSTer.
docker run --rm -v /opt/mister-groovy-relay:/config \
  jedivoodoo/mister-groovy-relay:latest \
  sh -c 'cp /config/config.example.toml /config/config.toml' \
  2>/dev/null || cp config.example.toml /opt/mister-groovy-relay/config.toml
$EDITOR /opt/mister-groovy-relay/config.toml

# 3. First run: link to your plex.tv account (interactive).
docker run --rm -it --network=host \
  -v /opt/mister-groovy-relay:/config \
  jedivoodoo/mister-groovy-relay:latest --link
# → prints a 4-char code; open https://plex.tv/link and paste it.

# 4. Long-run: detach and let it broadcast.
docker run -d --name mister-groovy-relay --restart unless-stopped \
  --network=host \
  -v /opt/mister-groovy-relay:/config \
  jedivoodoo/mister-groovy-relay:latest
```

`--network=host` is required. The bridge needs a stable source UDP port
(the MiSTer keys its session by sender `IP:port`) and it needs to
receive the Plex GDM multicast on `239.0.0.250:32414`. Bridged Docker
networking does not pass multicast and would rewrite the source port on
every restart — neither is workable.

## First-time setup walkthrough

1. **Install.** Pull the image (`docker pull jedivoodoo/mister-groovy-relay:latest`)
   or `go build ./cmd/mister-groovy-relay` if you want a native binary.
2. **Configure.** Copy `config.example.toml` to your `data_dir` as
   `config.toml`. The only mandatory edit is `mister_host` — point it at
   your MiSTer's IP.
3. **Link.** Run with `--link`. The bridge prints a 4-character code
   and the plex.tv link URL; paste the code at `https://plex.tv/link`
   while signed in to the Plex account that owns your PMS. The returned
   auth token is persisted to `data_dir/plex.json` (mode 0600) so you
   only do this once.
4. **First cast.** Drop the `--link` flag and start the bridge
   normally. Open Plex on your phone (or web client), pick a video,
   tap the cast icon, and select your `device_name` from the list.
   Playback should start on the CRT within 1–2 seconds.

## Operational notes

### Multi-NIC Unraid hosts

The bridge advertises its own LAN address to Plex (in the `/resources` response
and in the plex.tv device registration PUT). By default it auto-detects that
address by asking the kernel which interface it would use to reach 8.8.8.8 — a
trick that works when the default route points at the LAN.

On Unraid hosts with multiple network interfaces — typical combinations are
LAN + WireGuard, LAN + Docker bridge, or LAN + secondary subnet — the default
route may not be the Plex-facing one. Symptoms: the cast target shows up in
the Plex picker but "commands never arrive" — the controller is trying to
reach the bridge on an unreachable NIC.

Fix: set `host_ip` explicitly to the LAN IP the Plex controller can reach.
Find it with `ip -4 addr show | grep inet` on the host; the `br0` or `eth0`
interface IP on the same subnet as your Plex Media Server is what you want.

```toml
host_ip = "192.168.1.20"
```

Restart the bridge. Check the startup log for the `host_ip not set` warning —
if it's gone, your override took effect.

### CPU contention under Docker

The data plane pushes fields at 59.94 Hz regardless of scheduling pressure.
Under heavy CPU contention (Unraid parity check, mover, a co-tenant container
spiking CPU) the FFmpeg decoder can fall behind; the bridge covers with
duplicate-field BLITs, which the FPGA rescans — so the symptom is visible
motion glitches, not A/V drift. (This is by design — the clock-push architecture
trades a graceful fallback against a hard drift bug.)

If you see glitches during parity checks, cap container CPU with
`docker run --cpus=2 ...` or the Unraid template's CPU-pinning option so the
bridge has dedicated cores that aren't preempted. 2 cores is typically
sufficient for a single 480p transcode plus Groovy packet framing.

## Troubleshooting

**"The target didn't show up in Plex's cast menu."**
The bridge uses GDM multicast discovery (port 32414). Confirm:
`--network=host` is set; your LAN is not carving off mDNS/multicast
between client and server; you linked successfully (`--link`); and the
bridge process is running (`docker logs mister-groovy-relay`).

**"No video on the CRT."**
Check the MiSTer is running a Groovy-capable core and is listening on
the configured `mister_port` (default 32100). Try `fake-mister` locally
to confirm the bridge is sending packets at all:
`go run ./cmd/fake-mister -addr :32100` on the same host as the
bridge, point `mister_host = "127.0.0.1"` at it, start a cast, and
watch for `cmd 2/3/7/...` counts in the fake's summary output. If you
see packets there but nothing on the real MiSTer, it's network routing
or a Groovy core config issue, not the bridge.

**"Audio drifts over long playback."**
This bridge uses a single FFmpeg process with shared A/V timestamps, so
long-term drift is structurally mitigated. Short-term offsets usually
indicate host CPU contention — check for parity checks, scrubs, or
co-tenant transcodes competing with the ffmpeg worker.

**"The picture shimmers / fields look wrong."**
Flip `interlace_field_order` between `tff` and `bff`. The "correct"
value depends on your MiSTer core + cable path; once you pick the right
one it stays right.

**"Plex says the target is offline moments after casting."**
Almost always a `source_port` regression — if the bridge restarted and
bound a different ephemeral port, the MiSTer's session key no longer
matches. Make sure `source_port` is set to a fixed number in
`config.toml` and that nothing else on the host is using it.
